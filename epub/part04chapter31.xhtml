<p class="chapterOpenerText"><a id="page205"></a>Augustus Brine, Travis, and Gian Hen Gian were squeezed into the seat of Brine&#8217;s pickup. As they approached Effrom and Amanda&#8217;s house, they spotted a beige Dodge parked in the driveway.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Do you know what kind of car they drive?&#8221; Travis asked.</p>
<p class="para">Brine was slowing down. &#8220;An old Ford, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Don&#8217;t slow down. Keep going,&#8221; Travis said.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;I&#8217;d bet anything that Dodge is a police car. There&#8217;s a whip antenna pinned down on the back.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;So what? You haven&#8217;t done anything illegal.&#8221; Brine wanted to get it over with and get some sleep.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Keep going. I don&#8217;t want to answer a lot of questions. We don&#8217;t know what Catch has been doing. We can come back later, after the police leave.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">The Djinn said, &#8220;He has a point, Augustus Brine.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;All right.&#8221; Brine gunned the pickup and sped by.</p>
<p class="para"><a id="page206"></a>In a few minutes they were sitting in Jenny&#8217;s kitchen listening to the answering machine. They had gone in the back way to avoid the burnt, doughy mess in the front yard.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Well,&#8221; Travis said, resetting the machine, &#8220;that buys us a little time before we have to explain it to Jenny.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Do you think Catch will come back here?&#8221; Brine asked.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Travis said.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Can&#8217;t you concentrate your will on bringing him back until we can find out if Amanda still has the candlesticks?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying. I don&#8217;t understand this much more than you do.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Well, I need a drink,&#8221; Brine said. &#8220;Is there anything in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;I doubt it. Jenny said she couldn&#8217;t keep anything in the house or her husband would drink it. She drank all the wine last night.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Even some cooking sherry would be fine,&#8221; Brine said, feeling a little sleazy as he spoke.</p>
<p class="para">Travis began going through the cupboards.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Should you find a small quantity of salt, I would be most grateful,&#8221; the Djinn said.</p>
<p class="para">Travis found a box of salt among the spices and was handing it to the Djinn when the phone rang.</p>
<p class="para">They all froze and listened as the machine played Jenny&#8217;s outgoing message. After the beep there was a pause, then a woman&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Travis, pick up.&#8221; It was not Jenny.</p>
<p class="para">Travis looked to Brine. &#8220;No one knows I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;They do now. Pick it up.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Travis picked up the phone, and the answering machine clicked off.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;This is Travis.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Brine watched the color drain out of the demonkeeper&#8217;s face as he listened. &#8220;Is she all right?&#8221; Travis said into the phone. &#8220;Let me talk to her. Who are you? Do you know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Brine couldn&#8217;t imagine what was going on in the conversation.</p>
<p class="para">Suddenly Travis screamed into the phone, &#8220;He&#8217;s not an Earth spirit&#8212;he&#8217;s a demon. How can you be so stupid?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para"><a id="page207"></a>Travis listened for a moment more, then looked at Augustus Brine and covered the receiver with his hand. &#8220;Do you know where there are some caves to the north of town?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Brine said, &#8220;the old mushroom farm.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Travis spoke into the phone, &#8220;Yes, I can find it. I&#8217;ll be there at four.&#8221; He sat down hard on one of the kitchen chairs and let the phone fall into its cradle.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Brine demanded.</p>
<p class="para">Travis was shaking his head. &#8220;Some woman is holding Jennifer and Amanda and her husband hostage. Catch is with her and she has the candlesticks. And you were right, there are three invocations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Brine said. &#8220;What does she want?&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;She thinks that Catch is some kind of benevolent Earth spirit. She wants his power.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Humans are so ignorant,&#8221; the Djinn said.</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;But what does she want with you?&#8221; Brine asked. &#8220;She has the candlesticks and the invocations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;They&#8217;re in Greek. They want me to translate the invocations or they&#8217;ll kill Jenny.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Let them,&#8221; the Djinn said. &#8220;Perhaps you can bring Catch under control with the woman dead.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Travis exploded. &#8220;They thought of that, you little troll! If I don&#8217;t show up at four, they&#8217;ll kill Jenny and destroy the invocation. Then we&#8217;ll never be able to send Catch back.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">Augustus Brine checked his watch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got exactly an hour and a half to come up with a plan.&#8221;</p>
<p class="para">&#8220;Let us retire to the saloon and consider our options,&#8221; the Djinn said.</p>
